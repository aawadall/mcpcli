# MCP Client Package

The `mcp` package contains request and response types along with a simple client
for communicating with an MCP server. The client sends JSON encoded messages
over standard input and output and provides helper methods for the common
`resources` and `tools` operations defined by the protocol.

This package is primarily intended for use with projects generated by the
`mcpcli` tool. Generated server templates already include this package under
`pkg/mcp` and demonstrate how to register handlers and interact with clients.

## Basic Usage

```go
import "github.com/aawadall/mcpcli/pkg/mcp"

client := mcp.NewClient()
resp, err := client.ListResources(1)
if err != nil {
    client.PrintError("list resources failed: %v", err)
}
fmt.Println(resp)
```

For a complete example, see the server templates produced by `mcpcli generate`.
